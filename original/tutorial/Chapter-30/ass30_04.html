<h1>Early Floating Point</h1>

<a id="floating_point,_history"> </a>
<div class="left">

<p>
The
first digital computer
(according to some) 
the Z3, built by
<a  target="_blank" href="../../external.html?link=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)">Konrad Zuse</a>
in 1941
used floating point representation.
This computer had a clock speed of five to ten Hertz and a memory of 64
words of 22 bits!
(The earlier Z1 machine also used floating point, but was not quite
programmable enough to be considered a computer.)
</p>

<p><span class="highlight">
Early computers were built to do engineering and scientific
calculation
so the invention of floating point
happened at the same time.</span>
In later years it was realized that computers are very useful
things, and not just for calculation.
Often floating point was not supported.
</p>

</div>
<div class="right">
<p><span class="highlight">
Many early minicomputers and microprocessors did not directly
support floating point in hardware.</span>
For example, Intel processor chips before the 80486
did not directly support floating point.
A floating point operation in a program
(written in C, say) was compiled into a sequence of
bit-manipulation instructions that did the required operations.
Computers used for graphics or engineering calculation often
had an additional chip that performed floating point operations
in hardware.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight">
MIPS processors are very strong on floating point,</span>
and have supported the IEEE standard from their (and its) beginning.
MIPS chips are often used in high-end engineering 
and graphics workstations and
are famous for their fast floating point.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 4:</h3>
<p>
(Not very hard thought question: ) Do you imagine that in (say) 1975 that
the floating point methods used on IBM mainframes were the same as on
DEC minicomputers?

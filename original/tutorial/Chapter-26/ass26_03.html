<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->
<div class="answer">

<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No. You would like to call a useful
subroutine from many locations in a program.

<div class="left">


<p>
<span class="highlight">Especially useful subroutines are put into
subroutine libraries and can be called from many locations</span>
in many programs, and so, of course, they must
return to many different locations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">There is a problem with using <code>j</code>
for the call of and return from a subroutine.</span>
</p>

<p>
The
problem is illustrated at right.
The <code>main</code> routine is written
to call a useful subroutine
<code>sub</code> at several locations 
in the code.
But, as it is written, <code>sub</code> always returns
control to the same location.
Usually this will not work.
</p>

<p>
In the past, before the concept
was completely understood,
hardware support for
subroutines was missing.
Various nasty software tricks were used to
implement the idea.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight">
What is needed is a way 
to send
a <b>return address</b>
to the subroutine when it is called.</span>
Now when the subroutine finishes,
it passes control to that return address.
</p>

<p>
Of course, "passing control to a return address"
means that 
<span class="highlight">the subroutine loads the 
PC (program counter) with the return address.</span>
The next instruction fetch of the machine cycle
will get the instruction from that address.

<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 3:</h3>
<p>
(Hardware Design Question: )
How should the return address be passed to
the subroutine?
</p>

<ol>
<li> By placing it in main memory somewhere, or</li>
<li> By placing it in a register designated for this purpose.</li>

<h2>**Exercise 1  &#8212;  Prime Number Tester</h2>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer.
The program then tests if the integer is prime and writes
out its result.
(See exercise 4 in chapter 19.)
</p>

<p>
A number is prime if it cannot be divided evenly by
any number other than 1 and itself.
So you will need a counting loop that starts at two
and divides the number for each value of the loop counter
until the number is divided evenly or the limit is reached.
</p>

<p>
For the upper limit of the loop use the number divided by two.
(A better upper limit would be the square root of the number,
see below.)

<h2>**Exercise 2 &#8212; Integer Square Root</h2>

<p>
Write a program that 
asks the user for an integer and then computes the square root of that integer.
Use only integer arithmetic.
The integer square root of N is the positive integer X
who's square is exactly N,  or who's square is less than N 
but as close to N as possible. Examples: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>iSqrt(25) == 5</code> since <code>5*5 == 25.</code>
<code>iSqrt(29) == 5</code> since <code>5*5 == 25</code> and <code>6*6 == 36</code>, so 6 is too big.
</pre>

<pre>
<code>iSqrt(60) == 8</code> since <code>8*8 == 56</code> and <code>9*9 == 81</code>, so 9 is too big.
</pre>


<pre>
<code>iSqrt(0) == 0</code>,  <code>iSqrt(1) == 1</code>, <code>iSqrt(2) == 1</code>.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The integer square root is undefined for negative integers.
</p>

<p>
There are various fast ways of computing the integer square root
(Newton's method is one).
But for this program, use a counting loop that generates
integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and their squares 0, 1, 4, 9, ...
As soon as the square of an integer exceeds N, then the previous
integer is the integer square root of N.

<h2>***Exercise 3 &#8212;  Lottery Odds</h2>

<p>
To win a lottery you must correctly pick <code>K</code> 
out of <code>N</code>  numbers.
For example, you might need to pick 6 numbers out of the numbers
1 to 50.
There are 
</p>

<pre>
(50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46 * 45 )/(1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6)
</pre>

<p>
ways of picking 6 out of 50 numbers.
So your odds of winning are 1 in that number of ways.
If you must pick 6 out of 50 numbers, your odds of
winning are 1 in 15,890,700.
In general, there are
</p>

<pre>
N * (N-1) * (N-2) * (N-3) * (N-4) * ... * (N-K+1)
-------------------------------------------------
       1  *   2   *   3   *  4    * ... * K
</pre>

<p>
ways of picking <code>K</code> out of <code>N</code> numbers.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that 
asks the user for integers <code>N</code> and <code>K</code>
and writes out the odds of winning such a lottery.
</p>

<p>
Test that the program works 
for reasonable values of <code>N</code> and <code>K</code>.
For many values of N and K, 32-bit arithmetic will overflow.
For this program, just allow that to happen.

<p>
For these programming exercises,
use only those instructions that have been
discussed so far in these notes:
</p>

<tr>

</table>
 

<p>
In the <em>Settings</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine ON, Allow Pseudo Instructions OFF,
Load Trap File OFF, Delayed Branches ON,
Delayed Loads ON, Mapped IO OFF, Quiet OFF.
</p>

<p>
Run the programs by 
setting the value of the PC to 0x400000 and
then single stepping (pushing F10)
or by multiple stepping (push F11 and enter a number of steps).
Observing the results in the SPIM window.

<h2>*Exercise 1</h2>

<p>
<b>Modify</b> exercise 1 of the previous chapter
so that the value <code>x</code> is 
in memory.
Store the value of the polynomial back to memory.
The program will be similar
to <em>poly.asm</em> from this chapter.
Evaluate the polynomial:
</p>

<pre class="code">
3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 12
</pre>

<p>
Use symbolic addresses <code>x</code>
and  <code>poly</code>.
Assume that  the value in <code>x</code> is small enough so that
all results fit into 32 bits.
Since load delays are turned on in SPIM
be careful what instructions are placed in the load delay slot.
</p>

<p>
Verify that the program works by using several
initial values for <code>x</code>.
Use  <code>x = 0</code> and  <code>x = 1</code>
to start since this will make debugging easy.
Then try some other values, such as
<code>x = 10</code> and  <code>x = -1</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Optional:</b>
write the program following the hardware rule that
two or more instructions must follow a <code>mflo</code>
instruction before another  <code>mult</code> instruction.
Try to put useful instructions in the two slots that follow
the  <code>mflo</code>.

<h2>*Exercise 2</h2>

<p>
Evaluate the expression:
</p>

<pre class="code">
17xy - 12x - 6y + 12
</pre>

<p>
Use symbolic addresses <code>x</code>,
<code>y</code>,
and  <code>answer</code>.
Assume that  the values are small enough so that
all results fit into 32 bits.
Since load delays are turned on in SPIM
be careful what instructions are placed in the load delay slot.
</p>

<p>
Verify that the program works by using several
initial values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
Use  <code>x=0, y=1</code> and  <code>x=1, y=0</code>
to start since this will make debugging easy.
Then try some other values.
As an option,
follow the precaution for multiplication, as above.

<h2>**Exercise 3 &#8212; Horner's Method</h2>

<p>
Evaluate the polynomial:
</p>

<pre class="code">
6x<sup>3</sup> - 3x<sup>2</sup> + 7x + 2
</pre>

<p>
Get the value for  <code>x</code>
from symbolic addresses <code>x</code>.
Store the result at symbolic address <code>poly</code>.
Assume that  the values are small enough so that
all results fit into 32 bits.
Since load delays are turned on in SPIM
be careful what instructions are placed in the load delay slot.
</p>

<p>
Evaluate the polynomial by using <b>Horner's Method</b>.
This is a way of building up values until the final value is reached.
First, pick a register, say $7, to act as an accumulator.
The accumulator will hold the value at each step.
Use other registers to help build up the value at each step.
</p>

<p>
First, put the coefficient of
the first term into the accumulator:
</p>

<pre>
6
</pre>

<p>
Next, multiply that value by x:
</p>

<pre>
6x
</pre>

<p>
Add the coefficient of the next term:
</p>

<pre>
6x - 3
</pre>

<p>
Next, multiply that sum by x:
</p>

<pre>
6x<sup>2</sup> - 3x
</pre>

<p>
Add the coefficient of the next term:
</p>

<pre>
6x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 7
</pre>

<p>
Next, multiply that sum by x:
</p>

<pre>
6x<sup>3</sup> - 3x<sup>2</sup> + 7x 
</pre>

<p>
Finally, add the coefficient of the last term:
</p>

<pre>
6x<sup>3</sup> - 3x<sup>2</sup> + 7x + 2
</pre>

<p>
Evaluating the polynomial in this way reduces the
number of steps (and the amount of code).
If you want to save time, write and debug
each step before moving on to the next.
When you reach the final step you should have a
working, debugged program.
</p>

<p>
Verify that the program works by using several
initial values for <code>x</code>.
Use  <code>x=1</code> and  <code>x=-1</code>
to start since this will make debugging easy.
Then try some other values.
As an option,
follow the precaution for multiplication.

<h2>**Exercise 4 &#8212; More Horner's Method</h2>

<p>
Evaluate the following  polynomial using Horner's method:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx + d
</pre>

<p>
Now the values  for the coefficients <code>a, b, c, d</code>
as well as for <code>x</code> come from the <code>.data</code>
section of memory.
Some versions of SPIM do not accept a statement label of "b", so use "bb".
</p>


<pre class="code">
       .data
x:     .word    1
a:     .word   -3
bb:    .word    3
c:     .word    9
d:     .word  -24
</pre>

<p>
Load a base register with the address of the first byte of
the <code>.data</code> section.
Calculate (by hand) the displacement needed for each of
the values in memory and use it with a <code>lw</code>
instruction to get values from memory.
In a later chapter you will find a much more convenient
way to load and store values using symbolic addresses.
But don't do this now.

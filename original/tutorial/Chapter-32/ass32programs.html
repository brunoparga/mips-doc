Chapter 32 Programming Exercises

<hr />

<p>
If you have read the chapters on
subroutine linkage,
write each exercise as a
main program calling a subroutine.
Use either the stack-based linkage or the
frame-based linkage convention.
Otherwise write the program as a single <code>main</code>.
<p>

<p>
In the <em>Settings</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine OFF, Accept Pseudo Instructions ON,
Enable Branch Delays OFF,
Enable Load Delays OFF, Enable Mapped IO OFF, Load Exception Handler ON.
</p>

<p>
Run the programs 
by clicking <u>S</u>imulator<u>G</u>o and then OK in the pop-up panel.

<h2>**Exercise 1 &#8212;  exp(x)</h2>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for <code>x</code> and then computes 
<code>exp(x)</code> by using a Taylor series:
</p>

<pre>
exp(x) = 1 + x + x<sup>2</sup>/2 + x<sup>3</sup>/3! + x<sup>4</sup>/4! + ...
</pre>

<p>
<code>exp(x)</code> is e<sup>x</sup>, where e is the base of the natural
logarithms, 2.718281828...
You don't need to worry about the math behind this.
Just compute a sum of terms.
Each term in the sum looks like:
</p>

<pre>
x<sup>n</sup>/n!
</pre>

<p>
Designate a register to hold the current term.
Initialize it to 1.0 (the zeroeth term).
Term one is calculated by multiplying:
</p>

<pre>
term*x/1
</pre>

<p>
Term one is the value x.
Term two is calculated by multiplying:
</p>

<pre>
term*x/2
</pre>

<p>
Term two is the value x<sup>2</sup>/2.
Term three is calculated by multiplying:
</p>

<pre>
term*x/3
</pre>

<p>
Term three is the value x<sup>3</sup>/3!.
Term four is calculated by multiplying:
</p>

<pre>
term*x/4
</pre>

<p>
... and so on.
In general, after you have added term (n-1)to the sum,
calculate term n by
multiplying:
</p>

<pre>
term *x/n
</pre>

<p>
Keep doing this in a loop
until the term becomes very small.
Here are some example runs (with SPIM using single precision).
As usual, only the first seven digits printed have any
significance.

<p>
It might be helpful to first write this program in
Java or C to verify your design,
  and then to proceed with the version in
  assembly language.

<h2>**Exercise 2 &#8212;  pi</h2>

<p>
Various infinite series for pi have been discovered.
The first such series was
</p>

<pre>
pi = 4( 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - . . .)
</pre>

<p>
This series is of little practical value because 
enormous numbers of terms are required to achieve
good approximations (Acton, <em>Calculus</em>, 1999).
However, it does provide good programming practice.
</p>

<p>
Write a SPIM program that writes out the sum
of the first 1000, 2000, 3000, ... , 10000 terms
of the series.
</p>

<p>
As with the previous program,
  write a version of this program in C or Java
  first to check that your design is correct.

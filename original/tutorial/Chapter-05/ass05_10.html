<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->
<div class="answer">

<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  The book contains patterns of letters
but their context is different than
what you  (the "English Language Application") can process.

<!-- LESSON DIVISION -->
<div class="lesson">
<h1>Text Files</h1>
<!-- ../Audio/chap05-09.mp3 -->

<div class="left">
<p>
<span class="highlight">A computer application (a program) is the context
for the bit patterns of the input and output files it uses.</span>
Without a context, the bit patterns are just abstract patterns.
</p>

<p> 
Although there are some standard contexts 
(such as for text files),
many applications use a context that is their own.
For example, a new image format would be a new context and
would require programs  written to process data in that format.
</p>

<p> 
If you could somehow inspect the surface of a disk
and see the bit patterns stored in a particular file, 
you would not know what
they represented without additional knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Often people talk of "text files" and "MS Word files"
and "executable files" as if these were completely
different things.
But these are just sloppy, 
shorthand phrases.
</p>


</div>

<div class="right">
<p> 
For example,
when someone says "text file" they
really mean:
</p>

<a id="text_file"> </a>
<a id="file,_text"> </a>

<blockquote>
<span class="highlight"><b>Text File:</b> 
A file containing a sequence 
of bytes that encode characters.</span>
Bytes hold  bit patterns  
that represent characters
or control characters
using a character encoding scheme such as ASCII or UTF-8.
</blockquote>

<p>
A text file can be used with software
such as a text editor
that has been written to use the particular
character encoding scheme.
Some software (such as web browsers)
can be used with several encoding schemes.
</p>

<p>
Files containing bytes that encode
printable characters according to the ASCII convention
have about half of the possible patterns.
Software that expects text files can work
with the ASCII patterns,
but often can't deal with the other patterns.
</p>

<p>
Web pages are text files that (usually) use UTF-8 to
encode characters.
Some of the characters are instructions to the web
browswer about how to display the web page.
To see the characters in this web page, type control-U.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 10:</h3>
<p>
A <b>file compressor</b> is a program that
inputs a file and outputs a smaller file 
that uses bit patterns more efficiently 
that in the original file.
A decompressor restores the compressed file 
to the original version.
</p>

<p>
(Thought Question: ) When an ASCII file
is compressed, does the resulting file
contain ASCII characters?

Teletype
machines were used from 1910 until about 1980 to
send and receive characters over telegraph lines.</span>
They were  made of electrical and mechanical parts.
They printed characters on a roll of paper.
Various mechanical actions of the machine were requested
from a distance by sending
<em>control characters</em> over the line.
A common control sequence was "carriage return" followed
by "linefeed".

<blockquote>
<tt>In the early days of small computers (1972-1982) Teletypes were
often the  sole means of input and output to the computer.
These Teletype machines printed with  fixed-size characters
(like their electric typewriter cousins).
The tag used in HTML for fixed-size (non-proportional) font is 
&lt;tt&gt; -- which stands for "TeleType".
This paragraph is set inside 
&lt;tt&gt; ... &lt;/tt&gt;
tags.
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Sadly, the &lt;tt&gt; tag has been deprecated and is no longer used.)

Some models of Teletypes could be used off-line (not connected to anything).
The user could slowly and carefully type a message 
(or program) and have it
recorded as holes punched on a paper tape.
The device on the left of the machine
in the photo is the paper tape reader/puncher.
Once the paper tape was correct, the Teletype was put on-line and the
paper tape was quickly read in.
In those days, paper tape was <em>mass storage</em>.

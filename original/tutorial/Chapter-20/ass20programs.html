Chapter 20 Programming Exercises
</h1> 

<hr />
 
<p>
For these programming exercises,
use only those instructions that have been
discussed so far in these notes:
</p>

<br>
 
<table style="width:50%">
<tr>
<td>add   </td><td>div    </td><td>mflo    </td><td>slt, slti</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>addi  </td><td>divu   </td><td>mult    </td><td>sltu, sltiu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>addiu </td><td>j      </td><td>multu   </td><td>sra</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>addu  </td><td>lb     </td><td>nor     </td><td>srl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>and   </td><td>lbu    </td><td>or      </td><td>sub</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>bne   </td><td>mfhi   </td><td>&#160;  </td><td>&#160;  </td>
</tr>
</table>
 

<p>
In the <em>Settings</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine ON, Allow Pseudo Instructions OFF,
Delayed Branches ON,
Delayed Loads ON, Mapped IO OFF, Load Exception Handler OFF.
</p>

<p>
Run programs by 
single stepping (pushing F10)
or by  clicking <em>run</em> and allowing control to go beyond the program.
Implement while loops by branching to a no-op (sll $0,$0,0) at the end of the loop when the loop finishes.
</p>

<p>
A carefully thought-out and debugged flow chart will
cut in half the time it takes to do one of these exercises.
Plus you will learn good coding techniques and gain
insight into programming languages and language translation.

<h2>*Exercise 1  &#8212; To Lower Case</h2>

<p>
Declare a string in the data section:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
string:   .asciiz    "ABCDEFG"
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that converts the string to all lower case
characters.
Do this by adding 0x20 to each character in the string.
(See Appendix F to figure out why this works.)
</p>

<p>
Assume that the data consists only of upper-case alphabetical characters,
with no spaces or punctuation.

<h2>***Exercise 2  &#8212; Capitalization </h2>

<p>
Declare a string in the data section:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
string:   .asciiz    "in a  hole in the   ground there lived a hobbit"
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that capitalizes the <u>first</u> letter of each word,
so that after running your program the data will look like this:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
string:   .asciiz    "In A  Hole In The   Ground There Lived A Hobbit"
</pre>

<p>
Easy version: assume that the data consists only of lower case characters
and spaces.
There may, however, be several spaces in a row. 
Be sure to capitalize the first letter of the string.
</p>

<p>
Medium-hard version: assume that the data consists only 
of upper and lower case characters
and spaces. Alter a character only if it is lower case and
follows a space.

<h2>***Exercise 3  &#8212; Space Removal</h2>

<p>
Declare a string in the data section:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
string:   .asciiz    "    Is  this a dagger    which I see before me?     "
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that removes all the spaces from the string so that
the resulting string looks like:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
string:  .asciiz    "IsthisadaggerwhichIseebeforeme?"
</pre>

<p>
Be sure to end the result string with a null after its
final character.
</p>

<p>
Easy version: declare a second buffer to hold the result string.
Transfer non-space characters from the input string to the result string. 
</p>

<p>
Medium-hard version: 
Use only the buffer that holds the original string.
Use two character pointers, one for the current character and
another for its destination.
</p>

<p>
The logic for this can be tricky.
Figure out how you would do it with characters arrays in C or Java 
before you try it with assembly.
For testing, use a data string such as the following:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
string:  .asciiz    "aaaa bbbb  cccc   dddd    eeee"
</pre>

<h2>**Exercise 4  &#8212;  Array Maximum and Minimum</h2>

<p>
Declare an array of integers, something like:
</p>

<pre>
        .data
size:   .word 8
array:  .word 23, -12, 45, -32, 52, -72, 8, 13
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that determines the minimum and the maximum
element in the array.
Assume that the array has at least one element
(in which case, that element will be both the minimum and maximum.)
Leave the results in registers.

<h2>**Exercise 5  &#8212;  Ascending Numbers</h2>

<p>
Declare an array of integers, something like:
</p>

<pre>
        .data
size:   .word 10
array:  .word 2, 4, 7, 12, 34, 36, 42, 8, 57, 78
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that 
determines if the numbers form an increasing sequence
where each integer is greater than the one to its left.
If so, it sets a register to 1, 
otherwise it sets the register to 0.
</p>

<p>
Of course,
write the program to work with an array of any size, including 0.
Arrays of size 0 and size 1 are considered to be ascending sequences.
The array can contain elements that are positive, negative, or zero.
Test the program on several sets of data.

<h2>*Exercise 6  &#8212;  Paired Data</h2>

<p>
In this program data comes in pairs, say height and weight:
</p>

<pre>
        .data
pairs:  .word 5                  # number of pairs
        .word 60, 90             # first pair: height, weight
        .word 65, 105
        .word 72, 256
        .word 68, 270
        .word 62, 115
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that computes the average height and average weight.
Leave the results in two registers.

<h2>**Exercise 7  &#8212;  Array Reversal</h2>

<p>
Declare an array of integers in the usual way:
</p>

<pre>
        .data
size :  .word 7                     # number of elements
        .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that 
reverses the order of elements in the array.
The result will be as if the array were declared:
</p>

<pre>
        .data
size :  .word 7                     # number of elements
        .word 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
</pre>

<p>
Test that the program works on arrays of several lengths,
both even and odd lengths.

With
SPIM,
you write a program as one big source file.
All entry points are labeled, 
and subroutines can be called with <code>jal</code>.
However,
large programming projects
are usually written with dozens of source files
which are later on assembled (or compiled) and linked
together
(see
<a href="../Chapter-01/ass01_14.html">Chapter One</a>.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>
<span class="highlight">Operating systems often support <b>dynamic loading</b>,
where
the machine code
for a subroutine is loaded (by the operating system) only when a
running program requires it.</span>
After the subroutine is loaded,
its entry point is put into a jump table. 
A collection of machine code that
can be dynamically loaded is kept in a
<b>dynamically loaded library</b>.
</p>


<p>
Here is our example program modified to give the feel of this:
</p>
</div>

<br style="clear:both">
<pre class="program">
          .globl   main
          .text
main: 
          . . . .
          
          # Assume that when the program is first loaded into
          # memory that the subroutines are NOT loaded with it.
          # After running for a while, the program needs to
          # call sub1. Only at that time is sub1 loaded and
          # the first entry in the jump table is filled in.
          
          <span class="red">lw       $t0,jtable         # call sub1</span>
          jalr     $t0                # pass control

          . . . .
          # After running for a while longer, the program
          # needs to call sub2. At that time, sub2 is loaded
          # and the second entry in the jump table is filled in.
                    
          <span class="red">lw       $t0,jtable+4       # call sub2</span>
          jalr     $t0                # pass control
          
          li      $v0,10              # return to OS
          syscall

          .data
jtable:
          .word <span class="red">sub1</span>                  # Jump Table <span class="red">(pretend that the</span>
          .word <span class="red">sub2</span>                  # <span class="red">addresses are filled in at run-time).</span>
          
          .globl   sub1               # <span class="red">Pretend that this subroutine is loaded</span>
          .text                       # <span class="red">into memory only after the main routine</span>
sub1:     li       $v0,4              # <span class="red">has started running, and that its entry</span>
          la       $a0,messH          # <span class="red">point is then filled into the jump table.</span>
          syscall
          jr       $ra
          .data
messH:    .asciiz  "Hello "

          .globl   sub2               # <span class="red">The second subroutine works the same</span>
          .text                       # <span class="red">as the first.</span>

<p>
Pretend that at first only <code>main</code> and its
jump table are loaded into memory,
and that the jump table is full of zeros.
Then,
later on,
the program calls the first subroutine.
At that time,
the operating system pauses the program,
loads the subroutine into memory,
and puts its address into the jump table.
The program then resumes running.
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">Now the subroutine is called
using the jump table.</span>
The instruction
</p>

<pre>
<span class="red">lw  $t0,jtable  # call sub1</span>
</pre>

<p>
loads the first address of the jump table
into <code class="register">$t0</code> .
Then the <code>jalr</code> instruction calls it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>
Later on the process is repeated
with the second subroutine.
The instruction
</p>

<pre>
<span class="red">lw  $t0,jtable+4  # call sub2</span>
</pre>

<p>
loads the second address of the jump table
into <code class="register">$t0</code> .
The <code>jtable+4</code> means to use the
address that is four bytes away from
the symbolic address <code>jtable</code>.

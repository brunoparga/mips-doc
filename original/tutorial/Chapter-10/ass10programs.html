<h1> 
Chapter 10 Programming Exercises
</h1>

<hr />
 
<p>
For these programming exercises,
use only those instructions that have been
discussed so far in these notes:
</p>


<table style="width:50%"> 

<tr> 
<td>ori</td>	
<td>addu</td>
</tr>

</table>


<p>
In the <em> Simulator/Settings/MIPS</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine ON, Accept Pseudo Instructions OFF,
Enable Delayed Branches ON,
Enable Delayed Loads ON,
Enable Mapped I/O OFF, 
Load Exception Handler OFF.
</p>

<p>
Run the programs by 
single stepping (pushing F10).
Observing the results in the SPIM Int Regs window.
Check the <em>Registers</em> menu that the registers are displayed in HEX.
</p>


<hr />

<h2>*Exercise 1</h2>

<p>
Start with the source file for the program discussed in this and the previous chapter:
</p>

<pre>
## Program to add two plus three 
        .text
        .globl  main

main:
        ori     $8,$0,0x2       # put two's comp. two into register 8
        ori     $9,$0,0x3       # put two's comp. three into register 9
        addu    $10,$8,$9       # add register 8 and 9, put result in 10
</pre>

<p>
Modify the program so that it puts a 1 in register <code>$1</code>, a 2 in register <code>$2</code>, a 3 in register <code>$3</code>, 
and so on up to register <code>$12</code> (or higher if you wish).
Run the program by pushing F10 to single step.
Check the register display after each step.
</p>

<p>
Notice that in the QtSpim display the machine instructions of this program are loaded into memory starting at address 0x400000,
the beginning of the text segment of memory.

<h2>*Exercise 2</h2>

<p>
Create a source program containing the following lines.
</p>

<pre>
##  Put data into the data segment
 
        .data

data:
        .word   0               # put two's comp.  zero into beginning of data segment.
        .word   1               # put two's comp.  one into data segment.
        .word   2               # put two's comp.  two into data segment.
        .word   3               # put two's comp.  three into data segment.
        .word   4               # put two's comp.  four into data segment.
</pre>

<p>
Load the program into QtSpim and look at the data segment starting at address 0x10000000.
There are no machine instructions in this program so there is nothing to run.
Notice that fullwords (4 bytes) are used for each integer.
QtSpim memory can be displayed using binary, decimal, or hex using the menu under the "Data Segment" tab at the top.
Choosing a display option merely changes the characters used to display what is in memory. Of course, the contents of memory remains unchanged. 
</p>

<p>
Change several of the data in your program to large decimal values (say, 2435681).  
Load the program.  If memory is displayed in hex, the hex equivalent of the decimal values will be displayed.

  ** == moderately easy program
 *** == harder program
**** == project

<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No &#8212; you use a "drivers view" of the car which is
appropriate for driving and omits details not needed for that task.
Of course you don't <em>always</em> use that view.
If it starts raining and your car starts sputtering you
might start thinking about the coil.

Part of what makes a professional is the ability to pick a
useful model for the task at hand.

<h1>Memory Model</h1>

Modern 
computer systems nearly always use 
<a href="../Chapter-04/ass04_07.html" target="_blank">cache memory</a>
and
<a href="../Chapter-04/ass04_06.html"  target="_blank">virtual memory</a>. 
But our abstract view of memory
does not include them.
The purpose of virtual memory is to
make it appear as if a program has the full address space available.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight">
So our programming model has the full 32-bit address space.</span>
The purpose of cache is to transparently speed up memory
access.
So our programming model does not include cache.
Memory in the programming model is as follows:
</p>

<a id="memory,_abstract_view"> </a>

<p>
<span class="highlightred"><b>DATA: </b></span>
</p>

<p><span class="highlight">
MIPS memory is an array of 2<sup>32</sup> bytes.</span>
Each byte has a 32-bit address.
Each byte can hold an 8-bit pattern,
one of the 
256 possible 8-bit patterns.
The addresses of MIPS main memory range
from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF.
</p>

<p>
However, user programs and data are
restricted to the first 2<sup>31</sup> bytes.
The last half of the address space is used
for the operating system and for specialized purposes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlightred"><b>OPERATIONS:</b></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">The processor chip contains <em>registers</em>,
which are electronic components that can store bit patterns.</span>
The processor interacts with memory by moving bit patterns
between memory and its registers.
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>Load:</b></span> a bit pattern starting at a designated address
                 in memory
                 is copied <u>into</u> a register inside the processor.
                 The bit pattern in memory does not change.
                 </li>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>Store:</b></span> a bit pattern
                 is copied 
                 <u>from</u> a processor register to memory at a designated address.
                 The bit pattern in the register does not change.
                 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Bit patterns are copied between the memory and the processor
in groups of one, two, four, or eight contiguous bytes.
</p>

<p> 
<span class="highlight">
When a group of bytes are copied in a load or store operation,
only the address of the first byte of the group is specified.
</span>

<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 2:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Does a <b>load</b> operation change the bit pattern in memory?</li>
<li>Does a <b>store</b> operation change the bit pattern in memory?</li>
</ul>

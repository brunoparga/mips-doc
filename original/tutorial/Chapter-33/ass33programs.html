Chapter 33 Programming Exercises
</h1>

<hr />

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>
If you have read the chapters on
subroutine linkage,
write each exercise as a
main program calling a subroutine.
Use either the stack-based linkage or the
frame-based linkage convention.
<p>

<p>
In the <em>Settings</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine OFF, Accept Pseudo Instructions ON,
Enable Branch Delays ON,
Enable Load Delays ON, Enable Mapped IO OFF, Load Exception Handler ON.

<h2>Exercise 1 &#8212; Date</h2>

<p>
Consider the following structure:
</p>

<pre>
struct
{
  int day;
  int month;
  int year;
}
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that allocates memory for such a structure
and fills it in with values such as 9/7/2003.
</p>

<p>
Write out the values in the structure.

<h2>Exercise 2 &#8212; Array of Structures</h2>

<p>
Consider the following structure,
the same as for Exercise 1:
</p>

<pre>
struct
{
  int day;
  int month;
  int year;
}
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for how many
dates are needed and then allocates space
(all at one time) for that many structs.
</p>

<p>
Then, in a loop, ask the user for the values to put in
each structure.
Do this by initializing a structure pointer to the first
address of the allocated space.
Then add the size of a structure to it for each execution
of the loop. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, write out the contents of all the structures.

<h2>Exercise 3 &#8212; Array of Structure Pointers</h2>


<p>
Consider the following structure,
the same as for the above exercises:
</p>

<pre>
struct
{
  int day;
  int month;
  int year;
}
</pre>

<p>
In the static data section of your program declare space
for an array of up to 25 addresses:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
size:     .word   0
dates:    .space  25*4          
</pre>

<p>
Not all of the potential addresses will be used.
The field <code>size</code> starts at zero because
to start, none of the addresses are used.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for how many
dates are needed.
Set  <code>size</code> to that amount.
Now a counting loop executes for that many times.
Each execution of the loop allocates space for one data,
puts the address of that date in the array of addresses,
asks the user for values for that data,
and finally, fills the date with those values.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the program write out the values in the dates.
Do this by scanning through the array of addresses to access
each date.
(Probably the dates will be in order in a contiguous block of
memory, but a real-world program can not count on this being true.)

<h2>Exercise 4 &#8212; Image Allocation</h2>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for the
size of an image: R rows and C columns.
Then allocate space for R*C bytes.
</p>

<p>
Fill row 1 with 1s, fill row 2 with 2s, and so on.
Examine the data section of the simulator to see if you did this correctly.

<h1>Files</h1>
<!-- ../Audio/chap05-08.mp3 -->

<a id="DIR_(of_DOS)"> </a>

<div class="left">
<p>
<span class="highlight">Files
consist 
of blocks of bytes 
holding bit patterns.</span>
Usually the patterns are
recorded on magnetic 
media such as hard disks or tape.
Although the actual physical arrangement varies,
you can think of a file as a contiguous
block of bytes.
The "DIR" command 
of   DOS lists the number of bytes
in each file (along with other information).
</p>

<p>
Ignoring implementation details 
(which vary from one operating system to the next),
<span class="highlight">a file is a sequence of bytes on magnetic media.</span>
What can each byte contain?
A byte on a magnetic disk can hold
one of 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible patterns, 
the same as a byte in main storage.
Reading a byte from disk into a byte of main
storage copies the pattern from one byte to another.
</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>
(Actually, for efficiency, disk reads and writes are always done in
blocks of 128 bytes or more at a time).
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">So a file contains only bit patterns, as does main memory.</span>
What is represented by the bit patterns of a file
depends on how they are used.
For example, often a file  contains bytes
that represent characters according to
the ASCII convention.
Such a file is called a <b>text file</b>,
or sometimes an <b>ASCII file</b>.
What makes the file a text file is the
knowledge about how the file was created and
how it is to be used.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 9:</h3>
<p>
You (acting as an "English Language Application") find
a battered old book in a stall outside a bookshop.
You open the book to a random page and see:
</p>

<blockquote>
Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae.
</blockquote>

<p>
Is this book suitable for you 
(in your role as an English application)?

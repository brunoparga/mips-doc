<P>
In addition to simulating the basic operation of the CPU and operating
system, SPIM also simulates a memory-mapped terminal connected to the
machine.  When a program is ``running,'' SPIM connects its own
terminal (or a separate console window in <TT>xspim</TT>) to the
processor.  The program can read characters that you type while the
processor is running.  Similarly, if SPIM executes instructions to
write characters to the terminal, the characters will appear on SPIM's
terminal or console window.  One exception to this rule is control-C:
it is not passed to the processor, but instead causes SPIM to stop
simulating and return to command mode.  When the processor stops
executing (for example, because you typed control-C or because the
machine hit a breakpoint), the terminal is reconnected to SPIM so you
can type SPIM commands.  To use memory-mapped IO, <TT>spim</TT> or <TT>xspim</TT> must be started with the <TT>-mapped_io</TT> flag.

<P>
The terminal device consists of two independent units: a <EM>receiver</EM> and a <EM>transmitter</EM>.  The receiver unit reads
characters from the keyboard as they are typed.  The transmitter unit
writes characters to the terminal's display.  The two units are
completely independent.  This means, for example, that characters
typed at the keyboard are not automatically ``echoed'' on the display.
Instead, the processor must get an input character from the receiver
and re-transmit it to echo it.

<P>

The terminal is controlled by four device registers,
each of which appears as a special memory location at the given
address.  Only a few bits of the registers are actually used: the
others always read as zeroes and are ignored on writes.</CAPTION>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
The processor accesses the terminal using four memory-mapped device
registers, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:io_reg"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../../../usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.html"></A>.  ``Memory-mapped''
means that each register appears as a special memory location.  The
Receiver Control Register is at location 0xffff0000; only two of its
bits are actually used.  Bit 0 is called ``ready'': if it is one it
means that a character has arrived from the keyboard but has not yet
been read from the receiver data register.  The ready bit is
read-only: attempts to write it are ignored.  The ready bit changes
automatically from zero to one when a character is typed at the
keyboard, and it changes automatically from one to zero when the
character is read from the receiver data register.

<P>
Bit one of the Receiver Control Register is ``interrupt enable''.
This bit may be both read and written by the processor.  The interrupt
enable is initially zero.  If it is set to one by the processor, an
interrupt is requested by the terminal on level zero (bit 8 of Status
and Cause registers) whenever the
ready bit is one.  For the interrupt actually to be received by the
processor, interrupts must be enabled in the status register of the
system coprocessor (see Section <A HREF="node9.html#sec:mips"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../../../usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.html"></A>).

<P>
Other bits of the Receiver Control Register are unused: they always
read as zeroes and are ignored in writes.

<P>
The second terminal device register is the Receiver Data Register (at
address 0xffff0004).  The low-order eight bits of this register
contain the last character typed on the keyboard, and all the other
bits contain zeroes.  This register is read-only and only changes
value when a new character is typed on the keyboard.  Reading the
Receiver Data Register causes the ready bit in the Receiver Control
Register to be reset to zero.

<P>
The third terminal device register is the Transmitter Control Register
(at address 0xffff0008).  Only the low-order two bits of this register
are used, and they behave much like the corresponding bits of the
Receiver Control Register.  Bit 0 is called ``ready'' and is
read-only.  If it is one it means the transmitter is ready to accept a
new character for output.  If it is zero it means the transmitter is
still busy outputting the previous character given to it.  Bit one is
``interrupt enable''; it is readable and writable.  If it is set to
one, then an interrupt will be requested on level one (bit 9 of Status
and Cause registers) whenever the
ready bit is one.

<P>
The final device register is the Transmitter Data Register (at address
0xffff000c).  When it is written, the low-order eight bits are taken
as an ASCII character to output to the display.  When the Transmitter
Data Register is written, the ready bit in the Transmitter Control
Register will be reset to zero.  The bit will stay zero until enough
time has elapsed to transmit the character to the terminal; then the
ready bit will be set back to one again.  The Transmitter Data
Register should only be written when the ready bit of the Transmitter
Control Register is one; if the transmitter isn't ready then writes to
the Transmitter Data Register are ignored (the write appears to
succeed but the character will not be output).

<P>
In real computers it takes time to send characters over the serial
lines that connect terminals to computers.  These time lags are
simulated by SPIM.  For example, after the transmitter starts
transmitting a character, the transmitter's ready bit will become zero
for a while.  SPIM measures this time in instructions executed, not in
real clock time.  This means that the transmitter will not become
ready again until the processor has executed a certain number of
instructions.  If you stop the machine and look at the ready bit using
SPIM, it will not change.  However, if you let the machine run then
the bit will eventually change back to one.

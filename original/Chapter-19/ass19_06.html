<h1>CISC</h1>

<div class="left">
<p><span class="highlight">
A  <b>CISC</b> (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
processor has many instructions,</span>
some of them complex instructions
that do a lot per machine cycle.
The Intel processors are CISC.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight">
A <b>RISC</b> (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
processor has few instructions,</span>
most of them simple.
It may take several instructions
to do the equivalent of a CISC instruction.
The MIPS processors are RISC.
</p>

<p>
If  everything else were the same,
CISC would have greater throughput.
However, a larger
silicon chip is needed to implement 
the many complex instructions. 
This means that data must move through greater distances,
and that takes more time.
So the machine cycle must be slower.
Also, the instructions themselves take more time
to execute (usually more than several RISC instructions).
Fine tuning
the chip for speed is difficult when there
are many instruction types.
The simple instructions are compromised
by the complex ones.
But the simple instructions are the
most frequently executed!
</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>
Worse, it is hard to write a compiler that makes use
of complex instructions.
Compilers frequently compile programs into machine language
programs that use only simple instructions.
The MMX (multi-media extension) instructions 
added to Intel chips (in 1997)
are not output by any compiler.
(In 2015 compilers still don't use these instructions.)
</p>

<p>
These instructions are used in specialized functions written in assembly language.
The functions are assembled into machine code and put into libraries
which applications programs can call.
Systems software can put everything together into an executable.
(See chapter one page 13 if this is unclear.)

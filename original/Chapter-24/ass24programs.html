<h2>*Exercise 1 &#8212; String Length</h2>

<p>
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a
string and then calculates and prints out the string length.
Stop the program when the string is empty
(when the user hits "enter" without anything else on the line.)
</p>

<p>
Be sure to reserve enough memory in the <code>.data</code>
for the string.
Use indexed addressing to scan through the string.
Strings read in with the trap handler service include a
'\n' character at the end, followed by the null termination.
Don't count the '\n' or the null as part of the string length.

<h2>***Exercise 2 &#8212; String Reversal</h2>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for a string.
After reading the string into a buffer,
copy it in reversed order to a second buffer.
Write out the reversed string.
End the program when the first string entered is empty
(when it consists only of the end of line character.)
</p>

<p>
The input strings will be terminated with "\n\0".
Don't include these characters in the middle of the
concatenated string.

<h2>***Exercise 3 &#8212; String Concatenation</h2>

<p>
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for two strings. 
The strings are placed in separate buffers in memory.
Now, in a third buffer, create a string that is the concatenation
of the two strings.
Print out the new string.

<h2>***Exercise 4 &#8212; Triangle of Stars</h2>

<p>
Write a program that 
writes the following pattern to the simulated terminal:
</p>

<pre>
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********    
</pre>

<p>
The last row starts in column one.
Use a counting loop to print the five lines.
The body of the counting loop contains two
other loops which, in sequence, fill the line
buffer with the right number of spaces and stars
for the current line.

<h2>***Exercise 5 &#8212; Dot Product</h2>

<p>
Compute the <b>dot product</b> of two vectors.
A vector is an array of integers.
Both vectors are the same length.
Ask the user for the length of the vectors.
Then prompt for and read in the value of each
element of each vector.
Reserve space in memory for vectors of up to 10
elements, but allow vectors of any size one through 10.
</p>

<pre>
          .data
length:   .word 0
vectorA:  .space 40    # space for 10 integers
vectorB:  .space 40    # space for 10 integers
</pre>

<p>
The dot product of two vectors is the sum
of the product of the corresponding elements.
For example, <code>(1, 2, 3) dot (4, 5, 6)</code>
is 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32.
</p>

<p>
After computing it,
write out the dot product to the monitor.
</p>

<p>
Here are sample runs of the program:
</p>

<pre>
How many elements: 5

Next element in A: 1
Next element in A: 2
Next element in A: 3
Next element in A: 4
Next element in A: 5

Next element in B: 3
Next element in B: -1
Next element in B: 0
Next element in B: 2
Next element in B: -2

Dot Product is   : -1
</pre>

<p>
and
</p>

<pre>
How many elements: 25
Bad number of elements!
</pre>

<p>
and
</p>

<pre>
How many elements: -2
Bad number of elements!
</pre>

<h2>***Exercise 6 &#8212; Linear Search</h2>

<p>
Declare an array of integers:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
size:     .word 12
array:    .word 50,12,52,-78,03,12,99,32,53,77,47,00
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that 
repeatedly asks the user for an integer to search for.
After the user enters the integer,
the program scans through the array element by element looking for
the integer.
When it finds a match it writes a message 
and reports the index where the integer was found.
If the integer is not in the array it writes a failure message.

<h2>***Exercise 7 &#8212; Averaging Filter</h2>

<p>
Write a program that processes an array by
applying an averaging filter to it.
An averaging filter works like this:
create a new array where each element at index J
is the average of the three elements from the old array
at indexes J-1, J, and J+1
</p>

<pre>
          .data
size:     .word 12
array:    .word 50,53,52,49,48,51,99,45,53,47,47,50
result:   .word 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
</pre>

<p>
In the above, the second element of the result is
the average of 50, 53, and 52.
The first and last elements of the new array are
copies of the corresponding first and last elements
of the old array.
</p>

<p>
After processing, write the old and new arrays to the monitor.

<h2>****Exercise 8 &#8212; Selection Sort</h2>

<p>
Perform selection sort on an array in memory:
</p>

<pre>
          .data
size:     .word 20
array:    .word 99,23,45,82,09,34,71,64,88,42,12,87,33,36,83,18,17,04,52,46
</pre>

<p>
The selection sort algorithm looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
int out, in, min, temp;

// each time the outer loop is
// executed, replace the element
// at out with the minimum of the
// elements to its right.
for ( out=0; out&lt;size-1; out++ )
{
  min = out;
 
  // find the location of the minimum
  // in the remaining elements 
  for ( in=out+1; in&lt;size; in++ )
    if ( array[in] &lt; array[min] )
      min = in;
 
  // swap the element at out with
  // the minimun of the remaining elements     
  temp       = array[out];
  array[out] = array[min];
  array[min] = temp;  
}
</pre>

<p>
Write out the array after it has been sorted.

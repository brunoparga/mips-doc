Chapter 35 Programming Exercises
</h1>

<hr />

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>
If you have read the chapters on
subroutine linkage,
write each exercise as a
main program calling a subroutine.
Use either the stack-based linkage or the
frame-based linkage convention.
<p>

<p>
In the <em>Settings</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine OFF, Accept Pseudo Instructions ON,
Enable Branch Delays ON,
Enable Load Delays ON, Enable Mapped IO OFF, Load Exception Handler ON.
</p>

<h2>**Exercise 1  &#8212; Subroutines</h2>

<p>
Divide the last program of the chapter into
three parts: a main routine, a subroutine that creates
the linked list, and a subroutine that prints the linked list.
Have linked list creation routine 
ask the user for each value that is stored in a node.
The first value that the user enters is the number
of nodes that will be in the list.

<h2>***Exercise 2 &#8212; Linked List of Strings</h2>

<p>
Modify the program 
(either the one from from the chapter or
the one in Exercise 1)
so that the data in each node is a null-terminated
string.
For this exercise,
make all nodes the same size.
Allow for strings of up to 16 characters (counting the null).
</p>

<p>
Put the link to the next node in the first for bytes of a node
(this will make things easier later.)
The user enters string data in a loop.
The string "done" signals the end of input.
Print out the linked list.

<h2>****Exercise 3 &#8212;  Linked List of Variable-length Strings</h2>

<p>
Modify the program so that each node has the link
to the next node in the first four bytes,
followed by a null-terminated string.
Unlike the previous exercise,
allocate only enough memory for each node
to hold the link and the string.
Read the string into a buffer,
compute its length,
allocate enough memory for the node,
and then copy the string from the buffer to the node.

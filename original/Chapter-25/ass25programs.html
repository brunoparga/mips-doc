Chapter 25 Programming Exercises
</h1>

<hr>
 
<p>
In the <em>Settings</em> menu of SPIM set
Bare Machine OFF, Accept Pseudo Instructions ON,
Enable Branch Delays ON,
Enable Load Delays ON, Enable Mapped IO OFF, Load Exception Handler ON.
</p>

<p>
Run the programs 
by loading the exception handler
and clicking <u>S</u>imulator <u>R</u>un.

<h2>*Exercise 1 &#8212; Arithmetic Evaluation (stack-based)</h2>

<p>
Write a program to evaluate 
<code>3ab - 2bc - 5a + 20ac - 16</code>
</p>

<p>
Prompt the user for the values
<code>a, b,</code> and <code>c</code>. 
Try to use a small number of registers.
Use the stack to hold intermediate values.
Write the final value to the monitor.

<h2>**Exercise 2 &#8212; String Reversal (stack-based)</h2>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for a string.
Read the string into a buffer,
then reverse the string using the stack.
However, unlike the example in the chapter,
don't push a null character on the stack.
Keep track of the number of characters on the
stack by incrementing a count each time a character
is pushed, and decrementing it each time a character is popped.
Write out the reversed string.

<h2>***Exercise 3 &#8212; Vowel Removal (stack-based)</h2>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for a string.
Read the string into a buffer.
Now scan the string from right to left
starting with the right-most character
(this is the one just before the null termination.)
Push each non-vowel character onto the stack.
Skip over vowels.
</p>

<p>
Now pop the stack character by character back into the buffer.
Put characters into the buffer from left to right.
End the string with a null byte.
The buffer will now contain the string,
in the correct order,
without vowels.
</p>

<p>
Write out the final string.
